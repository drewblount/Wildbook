Note that (at least initially) links and emails generated by these forms 
appear as though they came from Wildbook and Wild Me, rather than the 
specific Wildbook instance that is deployed. E.g. a link in an email that 
might point to http://www.mantamatcher.org now points to
http://www.wildme.org/wildbook.

To customize these forms to a specific Wildbook instance, go through each form
and (either figure it out for yourself, or):
  + replace "Wildbook" with "ThisInstance'sName"
  + replace "animal" with "theAnimalWeAreStudying"
  + provide some contact info after "please let us know" on passwordReset.*
  + customize the mailHeader in email-template.html by modifying the commented-out example
  
Note that one or two sentences might need to be jockeyed around a tad to accommodate
these changes (e.g. changing an "an" to an "a").
